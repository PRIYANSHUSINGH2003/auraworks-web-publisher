## Task Overview
This project is a demonstration of my skills as a Web Publisher, showcasing the use of Next.js (React) and Tailwind CSS to build a responsive webpage. The goal of the task is to:

- **Build a responsive UI** based on a provided Figma file (PC and mobile views).
- **Upload the project to GitHub** in a public repository.
- **Deploy the project** using Vercel.
